# It is a single letter encoding for the bots logic

# This is a bit of work in progress.

# Action descriptions for the PBEM game tracking should be compatible with 
# Bot AI text decriptions.  Bots and PBEM games are unlikely to interact 
# directly in a single game; however, it may be useful to take a PBEM game 
# file and convert one of the players units and actions to a bot script.
#
# See bot format notes see TacicalGamebookTemplate.txt file.
#
# This will likely require some manual editing to create various 
# checks for solo play. It may be useful to create a wizard mode to process
# a PBEM game turns. If the bot is Player 2 then for Player 1 prompt the
# designer based on the Player 1 actions if they should be converted to
# activation, sighting, or event checks. Skipping particular actions and 
# merging bots could be useful features.
# 
# Compress Move Notation from the web for perspective taking:
# 
# Now let’s have a look at your pieces. They are abbreviated by capital 
# letters in the following way: K=king, Q=queen, R=rook, B=bishop, N=knight. 
# Of course, the knight can not be represented by a ‘k’ thanks to the king. 
# Maybe you’ve recognized that we haven’t mentioned the pawn. The pawn is the 
# only piece not indicated by a letter. Additionally, the capital letters can 
# vary according to the language of the country where you play chess.
# 
# If you want to write down a move, then you notate the capital letter for 
# the piece you use and the square to which you’ve moved your piece, for 
# example Qd3 (the queen has moved to the d3 square). If you want to castle 
# kingside, you write down ‘0-0’ while castling queenside is represented 
# by ‘0-0-0’. If a piece captures another piece, you write an “x” between 
# the capital letter and the square where you’ve moved, for example, Nxf3 
# (the knight (N) has captured (x) a piece on the f3 square). Check is 
# indicated with a plus at the end of the notation, while two pluses or a 
# hashtag indicate a checkmate. If a player offers a draw after his move, you 
# must notate it with a bracketed equal sign right behind the move like 
# this: (=). The two special rules, en passant and the pawn promotion, also 
# have special chess notation regulations. The pawn promotion is indicated by 
# the square the pawn has moved to and the piece it is promoted into, e.g. 
# b8=Q (a pawn has moved to b8 and been promoted into a queen). En passant 
# is just indicated by the normal pawn move and “e.p.” behind it, e.g. exd6 
# e.p. If two identical pieces can move to the same square, you have to 
# indicate which piece you mean by writing down the square on which it is 
# originally located right behind the piece, e.g. Nc2d4 (the knight on 
# c2 moved to the d4 square).
# 
# Draft work for PBEM Compressed Move Notation
#
# The notation uses lower case letters a-h for the x axis and 
# numerals for the y axis. Single upper case letters use for 
# specific units. Each turn starts with a numeral and dot to 
# mark the turn. Bots do not have turns but actioned based on 
# player movement.

# Action text is written in Markdown format. Notes from test session
#
# The notation below does not show facings but start and end spaces. Movement 
# facing and turning in an AI bot is an added complexity. Not planning on 
# using facing and turning as consuming movement points. Along this line of 
# planning is for elevation providing a +1 bonus to the defender. 
#
# There was a lot of missing at times due to the randomness of the dice. Even 
# so several of the units were getting shot up well enough. The to hit numbers 
# were as follows:
# 
# Gunnery 4: Short, Medium, Long
# Stand: 4/6/8
# Walk: 5/7/9
# Run: 6/8/10
# Jump: 7/9/11
#
# The coordinate encoding was a little redundant e.g. H0505 vs 0505 or f05.
# As the map was labeled it was easy to look at the map and record the 
# position. On several occasion I had to return to add the 'H'. Given that
# the map did not use a-o for x axis I thought it hard to translate that on 
# the fly. It was simply easier to look at the map hex and record it. 
# When looking at the notation, I reflected several times if there was and
# easier way to record coordinates because I had to make some edits to 
# keep it consistent.
#
# Having the start and stop position was very useful in backtracking which 
# I had to do on a few occasions. Firing is recorded as 'x0505' the hex 
# location so it is easy to record who is firing on which hex with which
# weapon and recording the result. It was necessary to refer to a turn's 
# stop space when backtracking to identify the unit being fired on from 
# the log. 
#
# In recording hits and misses I found that I frequently used spaces around 
# the commas. The spaces should be optional because it was hard to be 
# consistent. It was cumbersome to change case I used caps lock off most of 
# the time but did experiment with turning it on. 
# 
# I liked the single letter unit assignment but the two digit C1 unit threw
# off the column spacing. A minor imparement to readability. Column editing 
# was very useful but not having the column line up created extra edits. 
# Using the first letter of the unit model name as its variable was 
# straight forward to remember except in the case of the Catapult and 
# Commando. 
#
# The use of 'x', 'h', 'c', '+' felt very natural to read and use. 
#
# I recorded misses which would be useful for back tracking heat accumulation. 
# It would also be very useful to know misses because the AI bot will want to 
# make the same attacks regardless of the missing. I believe it useful when 
# refactoring a PBEM game into a bot. 
#
# At the start of each turn I created a number of rows for each unit with the 
# the updated turn number. I looked at the last turns stop positions to 
# record start positions e.g. deleted prior start positions.  Rolling team 
# initiative I use the map to make movement decisions. Units are put in order 
# by initiative.
