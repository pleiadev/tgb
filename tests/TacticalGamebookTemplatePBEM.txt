# the following is 15x17 map with details for the middle of PBEM game.
# It is a single letter encoding for the bots logic
#
# This is a bit of work in progress.
#
# Legend for the msp
# X - Is a don't care. Placed in any unused square. Could be terrain
# C - Denotes an activation check square (forks two outcomes)
# P - Denotes a pilot check square (forks two outcomes)
# A - Denotes an unit activation square
# E - Denotes an Event
# S - Denotes a sighting check 
# M - Denotes a unit move location
# C - Clear Hex
# V - Light Woods
# W - Heavy Woods

# Action descriptions for the PBEM game tracking should be compatible with 
# Bot AI text decriptions.  Bots and PBEM games are unlikely to interact 
# directly in a single game; however, it may be useful to take a PBEM game 
# file and convert one of the players units and actions to a bot script.
#
# See bot format notes see TacicalGamebookTemplate.txt file.
#
# This will likely require some manual editing to create various 
# checks for solo play. It may be useful to create a wizard mode to process
# a PBEM game turns. If the bot is Player 2 then for Player 1 prompt the
# designer based on the Player 1 actions if they should be converted to
# activation, sighting, or event checks. Skipping particular actions and 
# merging bots could be useful features.
# 
# Compress Move Notation from the web for perspective taking:
# 
# Now let’s have a look at your pieces. They are abbreviated by capital 
# letters in the following way: K=king, Q=queen, R=rook, B=bishop, N=knight. 
# Of course, the knight can not be represented by a ‘k’ thanks to the king. 
# Maybe you’ve recognized that we haven’t mentioned the pawn. The pawn is the 
# only piece not indicated by a letter. Additionally, the capital letters can 
# vary according to the language of the country where you play chess.
# 
# If you want to write down a move, then you notate the capital letter for 
# the piece you use and the square to which you’ve moved your piece, for 
# example Qd3 (the queen has moved to the d3 square). If you want to castle 
# kingside, you write down ‘0-0’ while castling queenside is represented 
# by ‘0-0-0’. If a piece captures another piece, you write an “x” between 
# the capital letter and the square where you’ve moved, for example, Nxf3 
# (the knight (N) has captured (x) a piece on the f3 square). Check is 
# indicated with a plus at the end of the notation, while two pluses or a 
# hashtag indicate a checkmate. If a player offers a draw after his move, you 
# must notate it with a bracketed equal sign right behind the move like 
# this: (=). The two special rules, en passant and the pawn promotion, also 
# have special chess notation regulations. The pawn promotion is indicated by 
# the square the pawn has moved to and the piece it is promoted into, e.g. 
# b8=Q (a pawn has moved to b8 and been promoted into a queen). En passant 
# is just indicated by the normal pawn move and “e.p.” behind it, e.g. exd6 
# e.p. If two identical pieces can move to the same square, you have to 
# indicate which piece you mean by writing down the square on which it is 
# originally located right behind the piece, e.g. Nc2d4 (the knight on 
# c2 moved to the d4 square).
# 
# Draft work for PBEM Compressed Move Notation
#
# The notation uses lower case letters a-h for the x axis and 
# numerals for the y axis. Single upper case letters use for 
# specific units. Each turn starts with a numeral and dot to 
# mark the turn. Bots do not have turns but actioned based on 
# player movement.
#
# 2. Qb3 e6  - verse- U0106.2 If s1 enter hex 4,9.

# Former lovely compactness and larger audience familiarity and later includes 
# options for ladder logic necessary for solo play. Different games will have 
# different coordinate systems in play.
