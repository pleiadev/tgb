<p align="left">Give a trap a special payload, coat a door, floor, or wall with 
a little something extra, or let a low level NPC drive heavy equipment are some 
good ways to make the world a dangerous place.&nbsp; What follows is Open Game 
Content from the SRD that can be copied into a DM's adventure notes.</p>

<h3>Slimes, Molds, and Fungus</h3>
<p><em>Green Slime (CR4): </em>A single patch of green slime deals 1d6 points of 
temporary Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first 
round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely 
destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or 
cut away (applying damage to the victim as well). Extreme cold or heat, 
sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against 
wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring 
metal’s hardness but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.</p>
<p>
<i>Yellow Mold </i>(CR 6): If disturbed, a patch of this mold bursts forth with a 
cloud of poisonous spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a Fortitude 
save (DC 15) or take 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. Another 
Fortitude save (DC 15) is required 1 minute later—even by those who succeeded at 
the first save—to avoid taking 2d6 points of temporary Constitution damage. Fire 
destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders it dormant.</p>

<p><i>Brown Mold </i>(CR 2): Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything 
around it. It normally comes in patches 2 to 3 feet in diameter, and the 
temperature is always cold in the area surrounding it. Living creatures within 5 
feet of it take 3d6 points of cold subdual damage. Fire brought within 5 feet of 
the mold causes it to instantly double in size. Cold damage, such as from a cone 
of cold, instantly destroys it.</p>
<p>*- Ability score damage is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*).</p>


<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>Lock: A lock is worked with a large, bulky key. The DC to open this kind of 
lock with the Open Locks skill depends on the lock's quality: very simple (DC 
20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), amazingly good (DC 40). </p>
<p>Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork: These manacles can bind a Medium-size 
creature. The manacled character can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free 
(DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). To break the manacles requires 
success at a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles 
have a hardness of 10 and 10 hit points. Most manacles have locks; add the cost 
of the lock to the cost of the manacles.</p>
<p>Caltrops: Caltrops resemble large metal jacks with sharpened points rather 
than balls on the ends of their arms. They are essentially iron spikes designed 
so that one point is always facing up. Scatter them on the ground in the hope 
that enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 
bag of caltrops (the 2-pound unit listed on Table: Goods and Services) covers an 
area 5 feet square. Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops 
(or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), the creature may 
step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the 
creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonus do 
not count. (Deflection averts blows as they approach, but it does not prevent a 
character from touching something dangerous.) If the creature is wearing shoes 
or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed at 
the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of 
damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is 
wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 1 day, until the creature is 
successfully treated with the Heal skill (DC 15), or until it receives at least 
1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop 
if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick 
its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>

<p>*Grenadelike weapons require no proficiency to use. See text for full details 
on using these weapons.<br>
**Grenadelike weapons deal splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of where 
they land.</p>

<p>Acid: Throw a flask of acid as a grenadelike weapon.</p>
<p>Alchemist's Fire: Alchemist's fire is a sticky, adhesive substance that 
ignites when exposed to air. Throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a grenadelike 
weapon.</p>
<p>On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 
points of damage. The target can take a full-round action to attempt to 
extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. It takes a 
successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames. Rolling on the 
ground allows the character a +2 bonus. Leaping into a lake or magically 
extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the flames.</p>
<p>Holy Water: Holy water damages undead and evil outsiders almost as if it were 
acid. Typically, a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead 
creature or an evil outsider on a direct hit or 1 point of damage if it splashes 
such a creature. Also, holy water is considered blessed, which means it has 
special effects on certain creatures. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a 
grenadelike weapon. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal 
creature, but against an incorporeal creature, the flask must be opened and the 
holy water poured out onto it. Thus, a character can only douse an incorporeal 
creature with holy water if he or she is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged 
touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit) because 
they are happy to supply people with what they need to battle evil.</p>
<p>Tanglefoot Bag: Throw this round leather bag full of alchemical goo as a 
grenadelike weapon. When the bag is thrown against a creature (as a ranged touch 
attack), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and 
then becoming tough and resilient on exposure to air. An entangled creature 
suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity. 
The entangled character must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or be glued to the 
floor, unable to move. Even with a successful save, it can only move at half 
speed.</p>
<p>A character who is glued to the floor can break free with a successful 
Strength check (DC 27) or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a 
slashing weapon. A character trying to scrape goo off himself, or another 
character assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is 
automatic, after which the character who hit makes a damage roll to see how much 
of the goo he happened to scrape off. Once free, a character can move at half 
speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a 
Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile 
after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Thunderstone: Throw this stone as a grenadelike weapon. When it strikes a 
hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang (a sonic attack). 
Creatures within a 10-foot radius must make Fortitude saves (DC 15) or be 
deafened. Deaf creatures, in addition to the obvious effects, suffer a -4 
penalty on initiative and a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a 
verbal (V) component that they try to cast.</p>
<p>Smokestick: This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, 
opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube. The stick is consumed 
after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.</p>

<p>Catapult, Heavy: A heavy catapult is a large engine capable of throwing rocks 
or heavy objects with great force. When fired, one of the crew makes a 
Profession (siege engineer) check (DC 20). If successful, where the object 
actually lands is determined by rolling 1d12 and consulting the Deviation (10 
Ft. to 16 Ft.) Diagram on page 68 of the DMG. The center is the desired target. If the 
check is failed, the DM secretly rolls and consults the same deviation diagram. 
The result is now where the catapult is actually aimed. This new result is used 
as the center to determine the actual deviation of the attack. For example, a 
catapult is used to attack a stone tower. The Profession (siege engineer) check 
fails, so the DM rolls 1d12 and gets an 11. By consulting the diagram, she 
determines that the actual target is 10 feet from the desired target, behind and 
to the left. Now, a crew member rolls 1d12 and gets an 8. After consulting the 
Deviation (10 Ft. to 16 Ft.) Diagram on page 68 to see where the object goes, 
the DM ascertains that it falls 10 feet short and to the left of the actual 
target, which is 20 feet to the left of the desired target.</p>
<p>Loading the catapult and preparing it to fire takes the full crew 8 full 
rounds. Initially aiming (or re-aiming) takes 10 minutes in addition to loading 
and preparation time. Three to four crew members can operate the device in three 
times this time. Fewer than three crew members cannot operate the device.</p>
<p>Catapult, Light: This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult 
(see that entry for how to operate it). Two crew members can load and prepare 
this device in 5 full rounds and aim (or re-aim) in 5 minutes. One person can 
crew the engine, but it takes three times the time to aim and prepare.</p>
<p>Ballista: The ballista is essentially a very large crossbow. It makes attacks 
with a straight attack roll (1d20) with no modifications (no character base 
attack bonuses, ability modifiers, etc.) except for range. Loading and cocking a 
ballista is 3 full-round actions.</p>
<p>Ram: This heavy pole is suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the 
crew to swing it back and forth against construction. Make an unmodified attack 
roll against the AC of the construction, with failed attempts dealing no 
significant damage. The ram can be used to make an attack every 3 rounds if 
fully crewed. With five to nine people, it can be used every 6 rounds. Fewer 
than five people cannot operate it.</p>
