<h1>Preparing Adventures -- Be prepared, be prepared, and be prepared!</h1>
<h4>Pleiades LLC</h4>
<p>Some would say that it is good to have a strategy. It even better to 
periodically review the strategy to stay focused.&nbsp; From time-to-time I'll 
review and update my notes on being a DM with tips I've heard  or lessons  learned 
from playing the game.&nbsp; Much of it is based on my own experiences or tips from  really smart DMs 
that come my way.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Get Started on the Game</h3>
<p>Start on focus on making the independent elements for an adventure. Just 
start to absorb all the game material. Think in lists! What you want to do is 
start building up lists of potential encounters, traps, characters, rooms, skill 
challenges, spell lists, etc. that you find appropriate for the players. They should be 
challenges that you would want to use or characters you would want the players to meet. 
The problem with random generators is that so often they are not the kinds of 
challenges that you would find appealing. They are random after all. The 
advantage in building the elements 
separately is for flexibility during the game session.&nbsp; Build level 
dependant items separate from the independent ones.</p>
<p>For example when designing a room try and figure out what it looks like and what 
the players might find in 
it. Make sure it is specific to your campaign. Do several 
rooms of the same type at the same time.&nbsp; Don't get into too many details 
with the game mechanics.&nbsp; If it has a trap put a note as to 
where the trap might be located and the potential trigger. Don't bother with 
game statistics for the trap at this time. 
The room might be used when the PCs are two or three levels higher so all the 
stats would require modification.&nbsp; That would be time that could have been 
better spent.&nbsp; As the PCs advance in levels just maintain a list of traps 
with the appropriate difficulty.&nbsp; Also, wizards, clerics, sorcerers, 
and druids all customize spell lists for different types of encounters so when 
you have idle time just build a spell list. Nothing more. Note the kind of 
encounter where it would be useful and save it with some of your other spell 
lists for NPCs. Next time you need an opponent you've got a spell list planned 
out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Published adventures are helpful because they have it all planned out and organized by character level.&nbsp; 
Message boards often  post maxed spells lists, 
characters feats, and anything else relevant to the game. Take advantage of all 
this free work.&nbsp; Start collecting all of these 
individual pieces and get organized. Keep track of them in different  documents or web pages. Make it easy to browse and edit the 
material. The more you do now, the easier it will be to put adventures 
together. Next time, you start to build material for a session put these 
independent elements together. </p>
<h3>Planning the Adventure</h3>
<h4>The Campaign</h4>
<p>Have a campaign outline that gets flushed out or updated after each session. 
Keep a calendar and figure out the next step. What it is that bad guys will do? 
What will happen next to the world?</p>
<h4>Adventure Outline</h4>
<p>
When getting ready for a particular session create an outline. Don�t go into 
super detail because the more detail you add makes it more likely that the PCs 
will do something you can not predict. Start by drawing or printing another map 
of the area surrounding the players. This map should show an area no more than 
20 square miles. Put game date on it. Plan out possible encounters based on the 
context of the adventure and mark the map where they might occur. Look at the 
outline for tasks that could let each of the PCs get a moment of glory. Look 
for locations that might require skill or ability check, trap, or treasure.
</p>
<p>
Now, realize that the events in the outline can be taken in any particular order. 
Keep this in mind when working on each part. Try and make them their own 
independent pieces. Be sure to allow for multiple ways to get to the same 
destination (Rumors, NPCs, etc to get them back on track). Try using a &quot;Choose 
you own adventure format&quot;. In each section note, if the PC�s do A then go to B 
and if the PCs don�t do A then write out an idea that might lead them back to A 
at some other point in the adventure. 
This prevents the DM from controlling the game and lets the player think they 
control their own actions and have more freedom.
</p>
<h4>Adventure Index</h4>
<p>
Start by creating an adventure index page. Have it with you as you do the second 
reading of the adventure or preparation for the next session. Look at the 
outline and see if there are parts of it that you can foreshadow earlier. 
Foreshadowing could be gear towards any part of the outline so make a note of 
it. They could be presented either as a narrative or interaction and could 
indicate a potential skill challenge or encounter to come.
</p>
<p>
As names of important people, places and things come up, write them down. If 
you are creating your own adventure get the list of names and start 
incorporating them. If your adventure has a town with 20 named folks, only the 
mayor, blacksmith, inn, and tavern owner need be mentioned along with the name 
of the town, tavern, and inn so group them together. 
</p>
<p>
When you're done, a good index should be easy to read at a quick glance. Mark 
page numbers to references that may be needed. Rolling names and details off 
your tongue with a quick glance instead of flipping pages is the sign of a 
professional.
</p>

<h4>
Foreshadowing</h4>

<p>This can't be stressed enough, but it goes a long way. It's also more work, 
but worth it. The best way is to keep one step ahead of the players and know 
where they are going, and what their interests are. For example, in a campaign  the party was 
going to come to a city where they needed to follow leads 
on a particular villain. When the players were lamenting their shortage of cash in 
their home city, they came across a wanted poster with a sizeable reward 
posted for the fellow in question. Another way to do this is to mention areas in 
your campaign world almost nonchalantly in your descriptions and NPC 
conversations. A Fletcher may make an off-remark about the amazing wood found in 
the woods of Celene, and later when an elf is found slain with a mark of a tribe from 
that wood, there's at least one player who will remember what the Fletcher said 
about the elf's home, creating a small but worthy tie to the players. This 
technique can only work best if you read ahead of the group...plant seeds, drop 
hints, etc. Only discovering things as the party comes to them makes them feel 
like they are walking from encounter to encounter.</p>
<h4>Recurring NPCs</h4>
<p>Keep up with the NPC's that players seem to keep an interest in. It's easy 
to see if you look for it. Say the barkeep's name and the player sit there then 
it is time to move on. Say the name 
of the local baron's son and the note-takers jot it down on their paper then check 
it off on the outline that is a name to remember! Next time when the players 
come through they may learn that the local baron's son has recently completed 
training to become a knight and his coronation is tomorrow. Put note on your 
adventure index next to that NPC. You've built in a world around the players, 
not just for them. </p>
<h4>Varied NPCs</h4>
<p>Try to vary NPCs from region to region, and quickly think for 
a moment about their reaction, needs, and wants. Speech, outward appearance, 
even body language should be noted. A list of notable persons, places, or 
groups in the area that the adventure takes place makes it easier to tie an NPC 
to the local region to add flavor. A mercenary that wears an old faded uniform 
of a Knight of Furyondy is more interesting. A weapon smith in a city rampant with 
rumors of an impending invasion from the nearby empire will have a whole 
different attitude, pricing, and workforce than the weapon smith in the peaceful 
outlander village surrounded by high mountains. When they deal with the 
players, have their personalities reflect their environments. That simple 
mercenary captain may just be gruff and covered with scars, but what if last 
night his betrothed left him for another...suddenly puts a huge spin on his 
presentation to your players and gives him life.&nbsp; Players are less 
likely to take advantage, or make light of their interactions with NPC's so 
played. </p>
<h4>Consequences</h4>
<p>If the party has impact on an area, if they know about it or not, remember to 
keep that in mind the next time they are around or in your NPC gossip. For 
example, suppose the group gets hired to explore a fallen meteor. They do, and 
discover a fell mind flayer that laired nearby and they return to the town with 
a trophy. When they return to the town in the future some folks are sure to 
remember them and comment on their past deed. Or they find themselves in a 
nearby town asking for adventuring help, and their employer mentions how he 
hopes they &quot;aren't crazy like the fools who tackled the mind flayer in the town 
over.&quot; If someone gives money to a beggar, beggars suddenly become their best 
friends. If a player makes mention of his favorite outfitter back in his home 
town, he may return to learn that the outfitter's business is booming from out 
of town orders. Best of all, set up things the party is meant to change so they 
feel they are interacting with the world, not that it's a static background set!</p>
<h4>Character hooks</h4>
<p>Players role-play based on scenarios presented to them. Knowing the 
players goals and motivations is  critical to the players role-playing. For 
example, the cleric receives a dream or for that matter the entire party 
instructing them to accomplish some goal. Pre-write each dream and hand them out 
for the players to read or read each one out, start them all out the same way 
but then change them to fit each player. Each will make a decision based on 
the their motivations. Add flavor, rinse repeat. </p>
<h4>Handouts</h4>
<p>Make notes on handouts that will be needed in the adventure and have them 
ready for the players as the game progresses. They're fun, and even more so if 
they're ready! </p>
<h3>Preparing Encounters</h3>
<h4>Treasure</h4>
<p>Figure out how much treasure should be awarded based on your PC�s level. Use 
this as your seed money to purchase magic items for NPCs and monsters and leave 
some as loot. PCs get a lot of magic items by winning it in combat but remember 
not all of it will roll into the PC coffers. Some of it will get missed  or used 
by the NPCs for combat.&nbsp; Include a lot more disposable magic items it is an 
excellent way to buff up NPCs and make them more challenging.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Encounter Levels</h4>
<p>Encounters that require skill checks for interactions or overcoming 
challenges should be rated so give out experience for accomplishing them. 
Look at the chart in the DMG and assign an EL based on the difficulty of the DC 
needed.&nbsp; Otherwise,  players will pursue more hack and slash 
opportunities because of the benifits. </p>
<h4>Challenge Ratings</h4>
<p>Trust in the system when preparing encounters. The proper way to make combat 
or dungeons harder is to run the encounters one after the other and not by 
adding more creatures to each encounter. Remember this when structuring the 
adventure.&nbsp; Each encounter is designed to drain 
resources. Wizards and clerics run out of spells and fighters run out of hit 
points. Space the encounters out by an hour of  game time and not real player 
time. Let spells durations from the previous encounter expire.&nbsp; Run the 
encounter again with the same statistics. The experience you award will reflect the difference 
between the two encounters. The first being relatively easy when the character were 
fresh on spells and hit points and the second being a little harder when the 
characters were more depleted.&nbsp; If you find players are one shot dying 
wonders or instant kills then you�re probably having problems structuring 
encounters. </p>
<h4>New Monsters</h4>
<p>Beware of the modules and source material that are used in a campaign. New material can be 
unbalanced or of poor quality. If you want a new monster take an existing creature and make minor 
changes like changing a resistance type or appearance but leave all the  statistics the same. 
Adding templates and class levels make for unusual monsters.</p>
<h4>Combat Stat Sheets</h4>
<p>Do Combat Stat Sheets! Role-playing is easy. You don't have to roll for initiative, 
keep track of positioning of foes &amp; friends, or track numbers. Combat is TOUGH 
if you're not prepared. Tough on you as you frantically look things up and tough 
on your players if you don't have the answers to the scores of questions they 
will ask. When combat comes, you want to be able to spring it suddenly on the 
players with &quot;roll for initiative!&quot; not &quot;hold on now while I look this stuff 
up...&quot;</p>
<ol>
  <li>A sheet to track individual initiative and spell durations throughout the 
  rounds.</li>
  <li>A sheet with the combat statistics of every conceivable participant 
  opposing the players. i.e. if a baatezu has the capability of summoning in 
  another type of creature to help it, get that creature's stats ready too, even 
  if it doesn't make an appearance. Tracking it in a word processor helps and 
  you can always use it in another adventure.</li>
  <li>A list of spells, items, skills, tricks,  traps, and tactics your monsters or NPC's 
  might pull off, or referenced page numbers in the game books.</li>
  <li>A clear roster sheet to track the accurate hit points of damage the 
  character's foes take. </li>
  <li>A clear roster sheet to track the accurate hit points of player damage for 
  those they lose AND recover during the session.</li>
  <li>Label miniature figures or counters and track them accordingly. Have this sheet done 
  in advance. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Encounters</h4>
<p>Get the miniature figures, counters, or props ready or know right where to get 
them. If you don't use either, know the scene so well that it's in your minds' 
eye to describe. Print out a second copy of the map to use as a tactical view 
then track changes on the map as creatures move around, open doors, and spring traps. Don�t use &quot;random encounters&quot; suddenly decided with a die roll. Every 
encounter is planned out in advance even if you�re not sure where to use it (thus the illusion 
of intermediate danger). Random encounters usually are impossible to predict, 
and hardly do anything to further the story and are hell to get ready for due to 
the complexity of running a smooth combat. Having the setting and miniature 
props ready ahead of time keeps the action fast and furious.</p>
<h3>Starting a Session</h3>
<h4>Recapping</h4>
<p>Set the scene by preparing player questions that the players should answer in 
character. After everyone has settled in at the table there's a dozen different 
ways to bluntly announce &quot;Okay, let's stop discussing movies and start the 
game&quot;. So instead just ease into it, ask each player their own question to 
answer in character to help everyone get into their role. The questions can be 
anything like about a character's family to what their favorite weapon looks 
like to asking them to prioritize their goals from a small list you provide. The 
answers usually reveal more about a character helping everyone to &quot;see&quot; them as 
well as give you some interesting idea hooks for future adventures! Simple 
answers, short answers, interesting retrospect and interesting in-depth answers 
are all cool, but the idea is to spend about one minute per player, and right 
afterwards recap the last session and get under way, now that everyone's in 
their character's mindset!</p>
<h3>In Game</h3>
<h4>Golden Rule</h4>
<p>Remember the Golden Rule. Information overload can happen so never loose 
track of your player's hit points! Of all the things you track it is the most 
important. The game has a lot of healing so the number can change a lot by going 
up and down. It can be very hard to especially at high levels where there is a 
lot of healing and damage being done. Regardless of whether you fudge numbers or 
don't, you want to be one step ahead of the players. If the character is going 
to die then you can always describe it heroic fashion. Soften the blow. </p>
<p>Whenever you�re about to do damage have this number in mind!&nbsp; Doing 
enough damage to hit the window where a player might be dying is more dramatic 
and also harder to do than hitting the window where the character is just plain 
dead.&nbsp; However, the former can be done a lot more often without huge 
negative effects on the player's feelings and be just as effective.</p>
<h4>Narrating</h4>
<p>There are two elements in relating the game to the players. Narrating the 
scene helps players visualized the scene as accurately as possible. Dialoging or 
role-playing is how players interact or relate to their environment. </p>
<h4>Environment Details</h4>
<p>In your villages, dungeons, and role-playing, HAM. Ham it up. You already 
know to describe a dungeon room with sounds, smells, lighting, and texture, but 
it can go further. Ham up your NPC's and you will discover  that those 
not too disposed to role-playing  slowly come around, playing off your 
impromptu acting.  </p>
<p>Avoid trouble transitioning from scene 
development to combat by giving better descriptions.&nbsp; Let players know what 
they can and can not see! Describe those items that are too far away or unable 
to be seen clearly.&nbsp; Many times all the details of the environment will 
have not 
have been related to the players before they start attempting to interacting with it.&nbsp; Be sure the 
narrative element is complete  within the players field of view. Let the players know what they need to do in order 
to resolve a particular detail before they actually do it or suffer consequences 
for doing it.&nbsp; When a player asks, &quot;How long is the corridor?&quot; Let them 
know that they will have to stick their head around the corner to find 
out?&nbsp; Describe the character's action and allow player's to inject feedback 
as to how the action is accomplished.&nbsp; Doing it in the fashion allows the 
DM and player to agree what is accomplished before the results of the action are 
determined or disclosed.</p>
<h4>Combat Details</h4>
<p>Combats desperately have a need for colorful descriptions: sword blows, near 
misses, etc. If you use miniatures, always track full movement with the 
miniature, don't pick it up and drop it elsewhere.&nbsp; As you move a miniature 
describe its flailing claws 
as it charges past the torchlight. The best way to perfect this technique is to 
read fantasy books and keep combat descriptions in your head to mix and match 
and develop as your own. Don't have foes walk up and attack, have them dodge, 
try tactics, flank, jump and tumble into combat! Suddenly the opponents aren't 
like drones waiting to be mowed down, but adversaries with personality.</p>
<p>Your view of combat is always going to be different from that of your 
players. If you feel things are a cake walk remember they may not. As a DM 
you�re going to be losing most of the time. It�s hard to tell the easy ones from 
the tough ones. It you think things are going to easy for the players then start 
embellishing the action verbally. Make it sound scarier or tougher. This and not 
on-the-fly adjustments should always be your first step. If you still feel 
things are not challenging enough then end the session early and go home (or to 
the bathroom) to look over the encounters. Always end the session when you�ve 
run out of prepared material. Not every session has to last three hours. Make 
this a habit. </p>
<h4>Slowing down</h4>
<p>Slowing down can address the basic problem when players don't spend the time 
of the session doing any of the prepared material. How are they going to spend 
it? If you want to stretch out the game session but not bore the players try 
embellishing the role-playing and scene visualization. Throw out an NPC or 
locale description and see if the players bite. If they do attempt to do some 
in-character role-play. Remember:</p>
<p>Going from place to place always take time even within the town so you should 
describe the scenery and the everyday scenes they encounter. Furthermore, many 
things can happen during that time including some of your prepared random 
encounters. You do prepare them?</p>
<p>Meeting people isn't automatic. The characters may have to work for it, pay 
for it, or find out who knows it. It might require building something or getting 
the raw material. Those they want to meet might not be at home, busy with their 
work, or just not trust the players yet. The actual act of talking to them does 
take time and getting them to talk can be an adventure. </p>
<p>Remember to always provide a couple of different ways for the players to 
succeed and feed these hooks in a timely manner; otherwise, the players will get 
distract. If the characters are on a clock, if they must hurry, then they won't 
spend time investigating side rumors or trying to get too high powered a magic 
item. A good way to control the pace of the session is to explain to them why 
what they plan is going to take a lot of time. You're the DM and you can make up 
a perfectly reasonable cause for the delay. </p>
<p>While you are using all these delaying tactics, listen to your players. You 
would be surprised by how many adventure ideas they can sound off while trying 
to understand what is going on. It many even be possible to tie one of them back 
into some of the encounters you have planned. You know your writing good 
encounters when you can use them in multiple ways.</p>
<h3>Ending the Session</h3>
<p>Ask the player for their plans. Giving the players treasure or money before 
the end of session can make them spend some game time planning purchases. </p>
<h4>Serial Ending</h4>
<p>Note their location and try to find a dramatic non-combat event to end the 
evening on (the seed to the next session).</p>
<h4>Award Experience</h4>
<p>Track experience individually and be sure to note the magic items character�s 
purchase. If a player has gain levels then remind them to bring you a copy of 
new character sheet.</p>
