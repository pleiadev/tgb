<h1 align="center">Encounters</h1>

Planning encounters can easily take up most of the time devoted to preparing 
adventures.&nbsp; The good news is that it is the most fun.&nbsp; The endless 
variety of combinations or min-maxing can mean tons of entertainment.&nbsp; A 
players are always limited by what they find within the context of the game.&nbsp; 
A DM has much more leeway in selecting what they can use. However, just remember 
that whatever cool items given to the villains will most likely find its way 
into the player's hands. Beware of what you wish.&nbsp; In order to maintain 
good game balance keep a few things in mind.<h3>Challenge Ratings</h3>
<P>Trust in the system when preparing encounters. The proper way to make combat 
or dungeons harder is to run the encounters one after the other and not by 
adding more creatures to each encounter. Remember this when structuring the 
adventure.&nbsp; Each encounter is designed to drain resources. Wizards and 
clerics run out of spells and fighters run out of hit points. Space the 
encounters out by an hour of game time and not real player time. Let spells 
durations from the previous encounter expire.&nbsp; Run the encounter again with 
the same statistics. </P>
<P>The experience you award will reflect the difference between the two 
encounters. The first being relatively easy when the character were fresh on 
spells and hit points and the second being a little harder when the characters 
were more depleted.&nbsp; If you find players are one shot dying wonders or 
instant kills then you’re probably having problems structuring encounters. Try 
using this Excel <a href="../files/AdventureRewards.zip">spreadsheet</a> to help 
managing Challenge Ratings, Experience, and Gold for a particular adventure.&nbsp; 
It makes a nice printout to bring along to the game.</P>
<h3>Treasure - Character Wealth By Level and Community Wealth</h3>
<P>Table 5-1 on page 145 of the DMG lists the balance guidelines for published 
D&amp;D adventures.&nbsp; For each level, it lists the maximum price in gold pieces 
for a magic item that a character might possess.&nbsp; Table 4-40 on page 137 of 
the DMG lists the price of the most expensive item available in a community.&nbsp; 
Keep this in mind when building villains.</P>
<P>So figure out how much treasure should be awarded based on the PC’s level. Use 
this as  seed money to purchase magic items for NPCs or monsters and leave 
some as loot. PCs get a lot of magic items by winning it in combat but remember 
not all of it will roll into the PC coffers. Some of it will get missed or used 
by the NPCs for combat.  Include a lot more disposable magic items it is an 
excellent way to buff up NPCs and make them more challenging.  </P>
