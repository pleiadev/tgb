<h1 align="center">Tricks</h1>

<p align="left">Give a trap a special payload, coat a door, floor, or wall with 
a little something extra, or let a low level NPC drive heavy equipment are some 
good ways to make the world a dangerous place.&nbsp; What follows is Open Game 
Content from the SRD that can be copied into a DM's adventure notes.</p>

<h3>Decoys</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Using False doors or items that are actually mounted to a surface that require 
  very high Strength checks to break off.</li>
  <li>Multiple locks increase time spent opening door or escape hatches, 
  increase Open Locks failure rate, and makes Knock spells less effective.</li>

</ul>
