<h3>Get a handle on Environments</h3>
<p>
DM should be able to construct and describe adventures that can challenge
players and part of doing this well is realizing that magic is not the 
answer to every challenge.  As Player's gain levels they will quickly
get access to powerful spells and magic items and the DM shouldn't rely 
on overly infusing the game with magic to properly challenge the players which can 
lead to a vicious cycle. A DM needs to learn how to construct an 
environment so that a non-magical setting can still challenge the players.

<h4>Fur and Humble Felt</h4>
<p>
Fur and humble felt in doors, shutters, and windows can be used to create air 
tight seals and was commonly used in the middle ages to protect against the 
elements.&nbsp; Leather is not a porous material and an air tight seal is useful in keeping out gaseous intruders 
and stopping gaseous attacks such as a <i>Cloudkill</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Glass is a more expensive 
solution and withstand liquids more effectively.
</p>


<h4>Tin or Iron Plating and Wet Hides</h4>
<p>Tin or iron plating and wet hides were layered on top of wooden structures to 
prevent or reduce fire damage.&nbsp; Wet hides could be quickly deployed in the 
event of a siege and plating could be layered and nailed onto structures for 
more permanent solutions.&nbsp; An attack that does fire damage might not 
destroy a wooden object unless the covering first fails its saving throw vs. 
fire.</p>
<h4>Double and Triple Locks</h4>
<p>Using more than one lock on a door or window will increase the number of skill 
checks and time need to get past barriers.&nbsp; A <i>Knock</i> spell can only undo two 
means of preventing egress so a triple lock can withstand a single knock spell. 
False locks could be designed to break lock picks or trigger additional traps.</p>
<h4>Dust, Soot, and Sawdust</h4>
<p>Sprinkling dust, soot, or sawdust on floors and walls can be used to detect 
the movement or passage of sneaky thief or invisible spellcaster.&nbsp; A 
character moving in the dark or using <i>Darkvision</i> might not notice the tracks 
they are leaving behind but a guard who knows to look for them sure would.</p>
<h4>Creatures with Scent</h4>
<p>A dog or other creature with Scent special ability would be invaluable 
additions to patrols for detecting and tracking intruders.&nbsp; They would most 
likely be in the company of a humanoid guard while on patrol or stationed in 
specific locations to sound an alarm if an intruder is detected.</p>
<h4>Meet My Little Friend</h4>
<p>Proper training or a simple spells like <i>Speak with Animals</i> makes it easier to 
train native creatures to perform more useful and critical functions.&nbsp; 
Flying or burrowing animals would very likely be trained to sound warnings or 
act as scouts when an intruder passes through their domain.&nbsp; DMs need to 
take advantage of useful classes like the Druid or Ranger when building any 
environment.</p>
<h4>Barbed Wire</h4>
<p>Embedding shards of glass or pottery into masonry is a very crude form of 
barbed wire.&nbsp; It can render grappling hooks useless and <i>Spiderclimbing
</i>mages or wall crawling thieves will no doubt not appreciate running across 
these impediments.&nbsp; Iron spikes and scraps of metal could achieve the same 
effect.</p>
<h4>Ballistae</h4>
<p>It only takes a single warrior to fire a Ballistae yet a single bolt can do 
an awful lot of damage to a high level character.&nbsp; If the Ballistae can be 
quickly reloaded and fired a low level guard can pose a threat an exposed 
assault force. </p>
<h4>Mage Shot</h4>
<p>Using special ammo such as Alchemist Fire, Thunderstones, Poison, and even 
creatures, like Green Slime, in siege weapons can give these weapons a little 
extra punch.&nbsp; A case of sling bullets can be wrapped in a leather shroud 
and fired from a catapult to make for excellent sources of artillery fire 
against Flying creatures.&nbsp; Splash damage from grenade attacks ignores the 
Miss Chances due to Concealment.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Towers</h4>
<p>The tops of towers are excellent platforms for Ballistae or Catapults to be 
brought to bear against Flying attackers.&nbsp; Partial and/ or dividing walls 
can be use to provide partial protection for siege weapons placed on top of 
towers.&nbsp; Dome covered towers with arrow loops embedded in the dome can 
provide protection for archers or pike men.</p>
<h4>Concentration Rooms</h4>
<p>A concentration room is a method of design that funnels attackers in such a 
way as to give defenders every possible advantage.&nbsp; Arrow slits, murder 
holes, pits, portcullises, oil spouts, and other devices are used to provide 
protection and repel invaders.&nbsp; Prisons are designed in this fashion except 
that they are designed in reverse to keep people within the structure.&nbsp; One 
or more concentration rooms might be used to protected against different egress 
points such as the tower top or dungeon entrance.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Partitions</h4>
<p>Frequent use of partitions would be incorporated into defenses to protect 
against area effect spells and grenade attacks.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Nets</h4>
<p>Nets can be used to capture flying creatures or grapple invisible intruders.&nbsp; 
They could be thrown from tower tops, shot from Ballistae, levitated into place, 
floated up on balloons, or strung between walls.</p>
<h4>Spares</h4>
<p>When the watered down skins protecting the building from fire damage dry out, 
throw on some more.&nbsp; If a passwall or disintegrate removed a portion of a 
wall levitate the spare stones in place before the wall collapses.</p>

<h4>Small humanoids</h4>
<p>Imagine a world where the rats and mice were organized, intelligent, and 
armed. Fey creatures like Grigs, Nixies, and Pixies that live in harmony 
with communities near them would protect and warn them to threats and dangers.</p>
