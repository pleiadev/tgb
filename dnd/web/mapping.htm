<h1 align="center">Mapping</h1>

<p align="left">Next to planning encounters, mapping second most time consuming 
task to prepare in planning adventures.&nbsp; It may require the development 
of several separate maps covering different locations. It can include time spent placing 
traps, disguising secret rooms, finding locations for encounters, and creating hiding places for 
treasure.&nbsp; This task could require separate player handouts be made 
available.&nbsp; Consequently, a map may 
have to be revisited several times to be adjusted for different elements of the 
adventure.  </p>

<p align="left">Its still faster to create a map by hand; however, hand drawn 
maps are messier to use when adjustments have to be made.&nbsp; When creating 
adventures in a word processor it isn't convenient to work on a hand drawn map 
while at the computer.&nbsp; I've learned a 
few <a href="mappingtips.html">mapping tips</a> the hard way when using electronic mapping 
aids that might be useful.</p>

<p align="left">Start with the Essentials. Determine the features and room types 
before the dungeon is mapped.</p>

<h3>Reuse the map</h3>
<p>Learn to reuse the adventurers current setting.&nbsp; Redraw or print a new 
copy of the map of the area surrounding the players. Make it no 
larger than a 30 square mile area and put a game date on it. Brainstorm and 
start planning out the 
possible encounters based on the context of the adventure and mark locations on the map where 
they might occur. </p>


<h3>Establish Bases of Operation</h3>

<p>Reuse detailed maps of locales that the adventurers frequent.&nbsp; The market where the 
adventurers shop, the inn they sleep in, taverns they frequent, and the road 
side leading into town are all areas that can be reused.&nbsp; When designing 
the location realize that the immediate area typically bigger than is currently 
needed for the encounter.&nbsp; Try focusing on only small sections of a larger map.</p>

<h3>Room Descriptions</h3>

<p>Save time by using utilities and generators that can fill in potentially 
mundane details.&nbsp; The great thing about random generators is that they kick 
start the creative process like flipping through a book.&nbsp; A generator can 
create a few entries that can be expanded upon until a desirable description is 
achieved.</p>
