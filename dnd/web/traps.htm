<h3>Traps</h3>
<p>Give the adventurers a chance!&nbsp; Always 
identify the trigger and for death traps always provide a way out. The Disable 
Device check is the mechanic that provides the escape but have a description in 
mind.&nbsp; Page 119 of the DMG 
has guidelines stating that the &quot;DC to find a trap or to disable it is generally 
20 + the dungeon level.&quot;</p>

<ul>
  <li>A non-Rogue has no chance of finding the trap with a DC higher than 20.</li>
  <li>A Rogue would need a 5 or higher from a maxed out Search (net +3 above the 
  character level/dungeon level), +5 from dexterity, +2 from a magic item, +2 
  from a feat, and +2 from some running enchantment on average.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Traps that require an 11 on a d20 check (50:50) are very deadly. To find 
  and disable the trap a Rogue would need two 11s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using traps too often can ruin the dramatic effect and slow down the 
pace of the adventure.&nbsp; 
A villain typically inhabits the complex so it is unrealistic that they would 
have a trap on every door active all the time. Catch the party off guard.&nbsp;Think outside the box! 
Put traps in areas where they will least expect them.&nbsp;The 
party wins initiative, charges across the room to face their arch-villain, and 
discover they rushed an illusion.&nbsp; Fiendish Death Trap!</p>


<p>Traps outside the dungeon: </p>


<ul>
  <li>The sinkhole in Potter's field or the weak (or weakened) floor in the 
  abandoned warehouse. Pit trap!&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Contact Poison swiped on the handle of a door during a chase or on mug of 
  ale in the tavern.</li>
  <li>Contact Poison placed on the corners of a book.</li>
  <li>Bucket of acid propped up on top of a door.
  <li>Building rigged to collapse  or catch fire.</li>
  <li>A barrel is released and pendulums across the bar striking an unruly 
  patron.</li>
  <li>Poisoned Caltrops placed on the floor, road, or forest path. </li>
  <li>Tripwire strung across the road causing a panel with short sharpened sticks 
to flip up or shoot towards a victim. Spear Trap!</li>
  <li>Terrain near a cliff or ridge can collapse to make  slides and chutes.</li>
  </li>
  <li>Loadstones (magnets) structures that attract metal trapping armored 
  adventurers.</li>
  <li>Net Snares or Bear Traps on foot paths.</li>
  <li>Dumping a pile of logs or avalanches of rock.</li>
  <li>A log pendulums through the forest striking an adventurer like a battering 
  ram.</li>
  <li>Tree limb tied back ready to snap the unaware adventurer.</li>
</ul>
