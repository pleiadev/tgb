<h3>Vary NPCs</h3>


<p>Vary NPCs from region to region.&nbsp; When creating one think about 
attitudes, needs, and wants. How do they speak and what kind of body language do 
they use?&nbsp; How do they dress or how are they different?&nbsp; What was the 
last major event in their life and how  has it affected them?</p>


<p>Working in a existing campaign then get a list of notable persons, places, or 
groups in the area and tie the NPC to the local region.&nbsp; Notable people 
have children, bastards, uncles, brothers, sisters, tailors, servants, and so 
on.&nbsp; Groups have supporters, ex-members, competitors, junior members, 
solicitors, 
as well.&nbsp; Places call for different types of professions. Shrines have 
priests and forts have guards with who they affiliate.</p>


<p>Varied NPCs: </p>


<ul>
  <li>An old knight of Furyondy, still wearing the faded old uniform, walks with 
  a wooden leg that was lost at the battle of Emridy Meadows now makes his 
  living running a smithy.&nbsp; His son has just joined the Furyondy army and 
  hopes to squire to a knight someday so his father keeps an eye out for local 
  Knights of the Watch.</li>
  <li>A serving wench at the Silvery Ladle recently arrived from the Shield 
  Lands where she had buried her second husband from the war.&nbsp; Her two 
  surviving children roam the streets during the day and have taken to 
  pick-pocketing to help put food on the table.&nbsp; There are plenty of 
  serving jobs but very few provide room and boards so she is stuck here.</li>
  <li>A young Mage of the Arcane Order in Mitrick has recent burn scars on the 
  left side of his body from the blast of a fireball that nearly took his life.&nbsp; 
  Upon his return his betrothed left him for another. His looks prevent him from 
  attending court which has drastically reduced his earnings.</li>
</ul>
