<h3>Foreshadowing</h3>
<p> Look back over the plan and see if  anything  can be 
Foreshadowed earlier.&nbsp; If all the adventurers do is discover things as they 
come to them then they are simply walking from encounter to encounter.&nbsp; 
Know the players interests, it is the best way to keep one step ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Read ahead of the adventurers and start planting seeds or dropping hints. </p>



<p> The sole purpose of a particular encounter might be to foreshadow a later 
event.&nbsp; See if a meaning be changed by delivering the clues in a different 
order?&nbsp; Consider that one of the clues may be inaccurate or distorted in 
some fashion as if seen from a distance or heard second hand.</p>



<p> For particularly tough encounters, events, or traps 
definitely consider providing advance notice. Especially, if the adventures will need 
special equipment or preparations.&nbsp; 
 
Don't be afraid to hit the players over the head by repeating or making it 
specific to the encounter.&nbsp; Reoccurring symbolism increases the tension 
more effectively, if the threat is palpable.&nbsp; Vague hints don't threaten.</p>



<p> Vague hints are better at adding mystery.&nbsp; They make the revelation 
more dramatic when the adventurers suddenly realize how all the pieces come 
together.&nbsp; If the adventurers are trying to piece together a puzzle 
consider hints that only make sense when all the pieces come together.&nbsp; 
When being subtle, the clue should be subtle but not the delivery.&nbsp; Make sure the adventurers 
notice foreshadowing.&nbsp; If they miss it then come back at them with it.&nbsp; </p>
