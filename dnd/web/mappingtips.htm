<ol>
  <li>Choose a background.  There is a blank parchment 
  that is a free <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/mapofweek/paper_620.zip">
  download</a> from Wizards.</li>
  <li>Next make the dungeon layout.  
  <a href="http://www.dungeoncrafter.com" target="_blank">Dungeon Crafter 2</a> 
  is an easy tile tool to use for interiors or villages. </li>
  <li>Take a print screen (Alt+Print Screen) of the dungeon and paste it onto the 
  Photoshop project.</li>
  <li>Use the Magic Wand (W) to remove everything from the screen shot except the tiles.</li>
  <li><b>Outline</b> the map using the Stroke command to create the outer walls.</li>
  <li>Add the <b>Drop Shadow</b> effect.  </li>
  <li>Add some images behind the tiles, <b>Fade</b> them to 15-20%, and <b>Fade</b> the borders 
  into the parchment.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Drop Shadows</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To do this create a duplicate of the layer with the image or text to drop shadow.</li>
  <li>Move the image 
  a few pixels to the side and a few pixels up or down from the original.</li>
  <li>Adjust the Hue/Saturation (Ctrl+U), check Colorize, and set the Lightness 
  value to -100.</li>
  <li>Gaussian Blur (Filter) the layer with a value of about 3.</li>
  <li>Adjust the 
  layer's Opacity (Layer Options) to perhaps 60-70% until the desired effect is 
  achieved.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Fading</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Select the image layer to fade.</li>
  <li>Select white as the background color, and make the image taller with Canvas 
  Size (Image | Canvas Size). </li>
  <li>Increase the height by about an inch while leaving the width the same and 
  click the box for the Top-Middle anchor. </li>
  <li>Leave about an inch of blank space at the bottom of the image that will be 
  trimmed off later. </li>
  <li>Use the lasso tool to draw around the part you want to fade at the top, but 
  be sure to bring it all the way down to the bottom white part.</li>
  <li>Feather the selection by about 40 pixels and Invert the Selection (Ctrl+Shift+I).</li>
  <li>Clear (Backspace) the selection, and Deselect (Ctrl+D). There should still 
  be the white space at the bottom of the image.</li>
  <li>Using the Crop tool, drag it from the top left corner to the bottom right 
  corner of the image, not the white space. After cropping the image, the white 
  space should be gone. 
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Outlining</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new Layer with the image or text you want to outline.</li>
	<li>Turn Preserve Transparency off and Stroke (Edit|Stroke) the layer with a 
	value of 1-2. Be sure either outside or center is selected in your location 
	setting.</li>
</ol>
