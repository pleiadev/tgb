<h3>Room Furnishings Generator</h3>
<a href="roomfurnishings.html">Room Furnishings Generator</a>

<P>This utility generates random room descriptions that can be used in dungeon, 
castle, or town setting and is inspired from the furnishings and tables in the 
first edition of the Advance Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide 
written by Gary Gygax. This utility is distributed at no cost and comes with no 
guarantee or warranty. </P>
<P>Designed to be useful for DMs working on adventures or encounters for <A 
href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=dnd/welcome,3">3rd Edition Dungeons 
and Dragons</A> game from Wizards of the Coast. Feel free to use this in your 
campaign and pass it along to your friends. Hopefully, it will add a little 
flair to all those other rooms in your dungeon that you just didn't have time to 
spend detailing. </P>
<P>Generated rooms do not include traps, monsters, valuable magic items, etc… It 
is focused on adding mundane items that do not have a large gold piece value yet 
speed the development of more detailed and varied environments. For the DM's 
that like to load up every room in the dungeon you can always load up your 
favorite random trap, monster, or magic item generator and just include it with 
the description. </P>
<P>The utility avoids being overly specific in regards to layout of items and 
uses relative terms like "Over there" (where?) or "Against the wall" (which 
wall?). For example, it doesn't include descriptions of doors and windows so the 
DM is free to customize the entry for a particular room either in their favorite 
word processor or on the fly. </P>
