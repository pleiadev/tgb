    <h2>House Rules</h2>
	<p>
	Whenever you want to make a new character follow the rules... 
	</p><p>
	Includes house rules for character creation guidelines, and
	rule interactions that might affect a new player.  I try and keep it 
	up-to-date but it is not meant to be an all inclusive list by any means.
	</p>
    <ul>
     <li>
	     The campaign is a core rule campaign so when in doubt consult the 
        Players Handbook (PHB).
     </li><li>
	     In addition to the core books the Dungeons and Dragons FAQ is 
	     consider an official source for rules clarifications.

     <h4>Abilities</h4>
	 <ul>
     <li>
	 28 Point Buy page 19-20 DMG prior to racial ability adjustments.  Characters 
	 created at higher levels get to assign the ability increases. I suggest 
	 using the character generator and leveling up four levels at a time 
	 to help avoid mistakes.
	 </li><li>
	 Pay attention to stacking, when tracking your Abilities.  Over the course of the
	 campaign, if your character were to gain access to two +1 Manuals of Gainful 
	 Exercise and use them both they would still only receive a +1 inherent bonus
	 to Strength.  If your character has a Strength 18 and uses one of these items
	 to give them a 19 then keep track of that fact on the magic item inventory 
	 sheet by doing something like: +1 Manual of Gainful Exercise (used).  It helps 
	 when I compare one sheet with another when a character levels up.

     <h4>Races, Classes, Skills, and Feats</h4>
	 <ul>
     <li>
        Race, class, skill, feats, etc... all have to come from the Players Handbook. 
        Prestige Classes require a mentor that will provide training to the character. 
     </li><li>
        The character level is one level below the average party level 
        (average party level - 1) for new character creation. 
     </li><li>
		Spell lists are restricted to the Players Handbook and a wizard's spell  
		compliment is the result of Spells gained at a New Level, PH page 155.
        Spell availability during the campaign is a DM decision. 
     </li><li>
		Character may take item creation feats as the meet prerequisites. Anything in 
		the DMG that has Creation Requirements (identifies caster level, required feats,
        experience expenditures, spell perquisites, and material components) is 
        available to the character to make. All the requirements will need to be met 
        and the DM decides on any vague descriptions. 
	 </li><li>
		<p>
	    Craft Magic Arms and Armor's Prerequisites is either Spellcaster level 5+ or 
		8+ Ranks Craft.  A character using the Craft prerequisite can only create 
		magic items for the Craft skill(s) they possess armorsmithing, bowmaking, 
		or weaponsmithing.  The character must posses three more Ranks in the Craft 
		skill than the Caster Level required for the magic item. Furthermore, items 
		created with a Craft skill prerequisite are always created at the minimum 
		Caster Level for the item. Unlike spellcasters, characters using the Craft 
		prerequisite are unable to set an effective Caster Level higher than the 
		minimum listed in the DMG.  
		</p><p>
		A character using the Craft prerequisite in lieu of having spell casting ability 
		must obtain the aid and counsel of a spellcaster with the appropriate prerequisites. 
		The cost for the aid and counsel help is determined by the Spells for Hire section
		of the PHB, page 114.  Spellcasters who perform this function are not expending 
		spell casting ability or spell slots but are acting to aid in the creation of the 
		enchantment. The character employing the Craft Magic Arms and Armor skill to 
		create the item must pay all associated costs including spell material components
		and XP costs. 
		</p><p>
		For example, a character creating a +1 large steel shield (+170 gp) for a 
		large steel shield (+1 bonus 1,000 gp) must have attained 6 Ranks in 
		Craft[armorsmithing] (Caster Level 3 + 3), paid 585 gp (1,170/2) in raw 
		materials and 47 XP (1,170/25).  It takes two days (1,170/1000) to create
		the item.  A character enhancing a +1 large steel shield (+1,170 gp) with 
		the Bashing enchantment (+1 bonus 3,000 gp) must have attained 11 Ranks 
		in Craft[armorsmithing] (Caster Level 8 + 3), paid 1,500 gp (3,000/2) in 
		raw materials and 120 XP (3,000/25), and spent 80 gp (1 Spell Level
		x 8 Caster Level x 10 gp) to obtain the counsel and research skills 
		of a spellcaster that is familiar with the Bull's Strength spell and has the 
		Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat.  It takes three days (1,170/1000) 
		to create the item.
		</p>
     </li><li>
        Craft Wondrous Item can be used to create items off tables 8-28, 8-29, and
        8-30 in the DMG.  It can not be used to apply the guidelines on DMG table 8-40
		to your heart's delight. It can not it be used to change the item's "slot" 
		or type of item created. A Cloak of the Elvenkind can not be created as
		a Vest of Elvenkind.

     <h4>Description</h4>
	 <ul>
     <li>
        All Evil alignments in the campaign are played as NPCs (under the DMs 
        control). The DM tracks and determines any character alignment changes. 
        In the campaign, if the character's development turns down the "dark" path
        then they become an NPC. 
     </li><li>
        Your character has to have a background to start the campaign. Be sure 
        to continue character development during the campaign it is the best way 
        to get what you want. If your character is well developed then almost 
        anything is possible. Write your own story and keep me informed of it. 
        I once saw quoted that the best comic book heroes are the ones with the 
        most convoluted past. The examples were the Punisher and Wolverine.
     </li><li>
        Rolls for Hit Points, gold, etc... have to be clearly declared and witnessed 
        by another player or the DM.  
     </li>
     <li>
		<p>
		When gaining levels a player may choose to take the value from the Average 
		Hit Point Per Level rule instead of rolling a Hit Die for Hit Points.  
		However, if the player elects to roll a Hit Die for Hit Points they must
		take the result.  
		</p><p>
		Average Hit Points Per Level is determined using the mean that the roll of a
		Hit Die would generate.  For odd levels a character would rounded up and one 
		even levels round down to the nearest integer.
		</p><p>	
		The Fighter has a d10 Hit Die so the mean would be 5.5 (1+10/2). For a Fighter 
		it works as follows: Upon reaching an odd level (level 3, 5, 7 etc.) a Fighter 
		would get 6 hps and upon reaching an even level (level 2, 4, 6 etc.) they would 
		receive 5 hps.

     <h4>Equipment</h4>    
	 <ul>
     <li>
		For characters starting higher than first level pick any personal equipment 
		out of the Players Handbook. Picking Master Work Weapons, Armor, and Equipment 
		is fine as long as its from the PHB. 
     </li><li>
        For characters beyond first level, starting gold is as a first level characters 
        except that it doesn't need to be spent it on equipment. It is your cash on 
        hand once in the game. Only first level characters will need to purchase
		equipment.
     </li><li>
	    Equipment (and magic item) purchases takes campaign time even between adventures.  
	    I use the digits of the item's value in thousands, tens of thousands, and 
		hundreds of thousands for days, weeks, and months to locate an item. Either by 
		using these values or rolling a d6, d4, and d12 for them instead is how I arrive
		at a date.  This is usually faster than 1000 gp rule that is used when making 
		an item.  Skills like Gather Information, Appraise, Diplomacy can affect the 
		search time and purchase price to the characters benefit or detriment.  A 
		player can save time by making reasonable estimates using these guidelines 
		and planning ahead.
     </li><li>
        Free market access to Spells tends to be regulated by the society in the 
		particular area that the campaign is situated.  Rulers just don't like it 
		when the populous buys a scroll or wand	of Disintegrate without permission.  
		This is why your spending all of your time in the dungeon.  It is recommended 
		that characters who want to purchase spells or items find a way to align 
		themselves with the power structures in play. Get what you want at character 
		creation or during level advancement. 
     </li><li>
        Characters don't start with any magic items. These are in game role-playing 
        rewards. It doesn't matter if you've created a character with item creation feats.
        Item creation feats can only be used in the campaign's timeline which doesn't start
        until a character has joined the campaign.

     <h4>Combat</h4>
	 <ul>
     <li>
	    <b>Casting on the Defensive</b> successfully only prevents the provoking of 
		<b>Attacks of Opportunity</b>. This does not counter a <b>Ready Action</b> to 
		<b>Distract Spellcasters</b>.  If someone where to Ready to Distract a
		Spellcaster then they could still take the Ready Action even if the caster 
		successfully Cast on the Defensive. If hit the spellcaster would need to
		make a Concentration Check.
     </li><li>
		<b>Massive Damage</b> is damage from a single attack. This is generally an
		attack that result from a single throw of the dice with in one round. There 
		are some funny rules that could trigger it. For example damage from falling,
		a Sneak Attack, or a Magic Missile spell cast against a single target could 
		trigger the rule.

     <h4>Adventuring</h4>   
	 <ul>
     <li>
        Every time the character advances a level they need to make the DM a 
		copy of the character sheet. They don't advance to the next level until
		the DM gets it. If you want to put it into game terms then the character
		is going to need training to advance which they won't get it until the
		DM gets his copy. Character sheets need to be readable (printed or typed).  
     </li><li>
        Remember when you advance in level your limited to what is in the 
        Players Handbook or DMG. The best rewards don't always come from the 
        core books. Getting prestige classes, skills, feats, magic items, and 
        weapons from other supplements is possible. Try and make me aware of
        what you want in advance. I can place it in the campaign like any other 
        treasure. I may require a copy of the pages out of the supplement since 
        I don't buy every rulebook under the sun. 
     </li><li>
	    Character death happens so remember running away and surrendering 
		is a valid strategy. Alternatively, the Players 
        Handbook provides at least six ways for a character to come back to the 
        campaign after death. Be prepared. Typically, this means a loss in a 
		level of experience.
     </li><li>
	    Charisma skills determine the outcome of NPC interactions but role-play 
        is the in-play mechanic that creates opportunities for a check.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Situational modifiers can be added to 
		opposed checks based on how well a player plays the character 
		(describes their own actions or motivations).&nbsp;  
     </li><li>
		The only strategy that comes into play in my experience is in the selection 
		of spells and purchase of magic items prior to encounters. Noticed that this 
		means an optimum planned strategy in the game is usually irrelevant?  
     </li><li>
        Players that experience uncertainty of what action to perform during combat 
        is usually a result of being presented with equally bad options (the technical 
        term is FUBAR).  Play to your character's strengths.  Actions that have the 
        most effect are thought up before your turn in the initiative order.  Just 
        wade in and remember to address any perceived flaws during the character's 
        advancement. Don't annoy the DM or other players with indecision - Speed up game play!

	 <ul>
     <li>
        The number of first level scrolls that can scribed per day is one. 
     </li><li>
        A Shadow Dancer Hide in Plain Sight (HiPS) ability requires the PC to be within
        10' of a shadow not their own.  A shadow cast by d6 lying on the game table is not 
        sufficient to hide in.  For game purposes, the shadow must be at least one size category
        smaller character's size type in order to hide in it. If the character is medium size
        then they could hide in a small sized shadow.  An overhead light would cast a tiny 
        shadow for a small creature and a small shadow for a medium sized creature.  A torch
        would cast a medium sized shadow for a small creature and large shadow for a medium
        sized creature.

	  <h4>Spells</h4>   
	  <ul>
		<li>
		<b>Detect Magic</b>
		<p>
        Detect magic doesn't work with Identify to determine the number of enchantments a magic 
        item has.  For a +1 flaming long sword: Detect Magic would in the first round reveal a 
        magical aura, in the second would reveal that the aura is faint, and the third could 
		show that the school involved is Transmutation. The presence of the +1 enchantment
		tends to overpower or mask additional enchantments placed within items.  
		</p><p>Identify would reveal the item to be +1 to attack and damage.  Analyze Dweomer 
		would reveal the +1 enchantment and flaming property with successful checks. Augury 
		can only see into the future about a half an hour so using it to see whether Analyze 
		Dweomer, which requires 8 hours to cast, would be beneficial would not provide any 
		useful information.  Divination would provide useful information in determining 
		whether Analyzed Dweomer is needed. A properly worded Divination could even provide 
		information revealing the nature of the additional enchantment.
		</p>	
		</li><li>
		<b>Dimensional Anchor</b>
		<p>
		Dimensional Anchor is useful for a short term effects such as with traps. 
		Additionally, the color of the Dimensional Anchor field lends itself to the source 
		of another form of prevention of Astral or Ethereal travel. Emeralds are often used 
		in the creation of treasure vaults or tombs to line walls and prevent extra-planar 
		entry.  Mines and underground locations may be rich in emerald deposits as well.  
		</p><p>
		Using ground up emerald gems in mortar while expensive in construction can prevent 
		such travel through those surfaces;however, it is not an end in and unto itself.  
		A repair made years after the initial construction that does not use this technique 
		would create holes in this protection.  Entrances and Exits are hard to protect using 
		this technique. 
		</p>	
		</li><li>
		<p>
		<b>Ethereal Jaunt and Etherealness</b>
		<p>
		The Manual of the Planes has some good ideas for protecting locations from Ethereal
		intrusion.  Sending a mountain or hill into the Ethereal plane and then building 
		your home on that site is a good but expensive means to keep out Ethereal creatures.
		Forbiddance is also useful.
		</p>	
		</li><li>
		<b>Teleport</b>
		<p>
		Teleport requires the caster to have a clear idea of the location and layout of the
		destination.  Enough to clearly visualize the location.  You need to know where the 
		location is, what it looks like, or what is inside of it.  
		</p><p>
        Using Teleport in the campaign is like locating a specific point on a map.  Having 
        the address (knowing where you want to go) results in having a good chance to getting 
        there, even if you don't know where you are.  If you've accessed some location via a 
        portal or gate but don't know where you are then your chances of returning once you
        leave are slim. However, you chances of leaving are good (assuming your on the same 
        plane and not anchored dimensionally).  
		</p><p>
		Additionally, many individuals know of this magic and seek to protect themselves from 
		the unwanted appearance of uninvited guests.  Re-arranging furniture, changing room 
		furnishings, or re-doing the walls are usually enough to foil most unwanted teleports 
		attempts. Plus, it keeps the place clean and refreshing.  Those who are more 
		unscrupulous and persistant tend attempt to bribe friends and servants for the 
		information. This can lead to even more furniture re-arrangement, watch lists, black 
		lists, or even changing venues for those without higher means.  Those of means find
		spells like Forbiddance or Dimensional Anchor to highly useful and perhaps even 
		necessary.
		</p><p>
		This problem tends to take care of itself in natural settings which have a tendancy
		to overgrow themselves and eliminating the problem.  Sounds of trees falling in the 
		forest and all that jazz.  For the wilds that don't change fast enough local Druids 
		usually step to preserve the sanctity of a natural setting.  Befriending the local 
		Druid is usually a good idea if you want them to show you the maintained "way station"
		set aside for such use.
