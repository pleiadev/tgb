<h1 align="center">Consequences</h1>
<p>The party has impact on an area, even if they know about it or not. Keep that in mind next time they are around or in your NPC gossip.&nbsp; Set up 
events that the party is meant to change. They must interact with 
the world and not act against a static environment!</p>


<h3>Recurring NPCs</h3>
<p>Maintain the NPCs that the adventurers find interesting. Do they write down 
the name of NPC when  mentioned? No, its time to move on. Yes, then check 
off that NPC to come back and revisit after the game session. Perhaps the next 
time the adventurers encounter the NPC they will find them married, having 
kids, or changed in some fashion.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Recurring NPCs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support the adventurers: smith repairing armor, wizard selling magic 
  items, or the inn keeper they room with at while in town.</li>
  <li>Tie adventurers to the locals: snitch connected in the thieves guild, 
  daughter of a local baron, or guard on the night watch.</li>
  <li>Make the adventurers famous: the messenger saved from bandits, peasant 
  returned to his homeland, or local lady in need of rescuing.</li>
  <li>Cause the adventurers problems: pick their pockets, bad mouth their 
  reputation, or compete for their work.</li>
  <li>Are mortal enemies: plots assassinations on adventurers, sets up ambushes, 
  kidnaps their allies.</li>
</ul>
