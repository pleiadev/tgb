<h3>Puzzles</h3>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Standardized test review guides are good sources for learning how build good 
puzzles quickly.&nbsp; The LSAT tests in particular have great test preparation 
guides.&nbsp; One approach to solving logic problems is to visualize the 
problem and use this technique when creating puzzles. </p>

<p>Example: Consider the following diagram the letters A-I could symbolize 
runes, names of greyhawk gods, arcane marks, etc. Create a set of rules that 
uniquely identifies the layout. </p>
    
<ul>
      <li>A &amp; C must appear in the same row and  opposite each other.</li>
      <li>G &amp; I must appear in the same row and  opposite each other.</li>
      <li>D &amp; F must appear in the same row and  opposite each other.</li>
      <li>B &amp; D can not appear in the same row.</li>
      <li>H &amp; F can not appear in the same row.</li>
      <li>A must appear before D.</li>
      <li>D must appear before I.</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The puzzle starts with E fixed in the center square and the symbols 
    themselves. The challenge for the party is to figure out the rules and the 
    solution to the puzzle.  For example, some rules could be handed out 
    based on the results of an Intelligence check, others littered 
    throughout the dungeon, and the final from an NPC.  Consider changing 
    the wording subtly to describe the following alignment table.</p>

The previous table the entries are symmetrical that would be too easy.&nbsp; 
Also, it is a 
    large puzzle but could be smaller or a different shape such as a ring or t-shape.&nbsp; The key 
to creating the puzzle is that the rules are generated from a visual 
    placement but they don't have to describe a visual placement.<p>This box 
could appear as a ring with the following rules.<ul>
  <li>F or G must be chosen but F &amp; G can not be chosen.</li>
  <li>H or D must be chosen but H &amp; D can not be chosen.</li>
  <li>A can not be selected unless C is selected.</li>
  <li>B can not be selected unless D is selected.</li>
  <li>If A is selected then G and I must not be chosen.</li>
  <li>If I is selected then neither E nor F can be chosen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The puzzle starts with no fixed letters and the symbols A-I. This adds a 
  layer of complexity since some symbols that will need to be ruled out first.&nbsp; 
  Next the placement rules.<ul>
    <li>F must appear adjacent to C.</li>
    <li>B must oppose E.</li>
    <li>B splits A and C.</li>
    <li>D touches upon A and E.</li>
    <li>F must appear adjacent to E.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One last wrinkle. This puzzle is a ring so it needs an orientation.</td>

	Scheduling is another type of visual puzzle that is easy to set up and vary 
	but requires some mental exercise to solve.  Create rules for filling the 
	schedule.<ul>
	<li>If A is scheduled  then C must be scheduled on following day.</li>
	<li>If D is scheduled then E must be scheduled for the same day.</li>
	<li>B must be scheduled earlier in the week than D.</li>
	<li>F must be scheduled later in the week than E.</li>
	<li>None many be scheduled for more than twice in one week.</li>
	<li>None many be scheduled more than once for the same day.</li>
	<li>The complete roster includes A,B,C,D,E,F, and G.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>The puzzle starts with one or two fixed pieces and the roster.&nbsp; If D 
    and E are scheduled on Day 3 then what are possible solutions?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Standardized tests also feature problems geared towards arranging schedules, 
placing people in rooms, etc.. </p>
