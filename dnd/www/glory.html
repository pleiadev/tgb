<h1 align="center">Glory</h1>
<h3>Share the glory</h3>
<p>Examine the outline for tasks that might allow each member a moment of glory.&nbsp; 
Look at the party's character sheets for weaknesses.&nbsp; Is there a character 
who has scores in a particular area that the other lack?&nbsp; Can one of the 
adventure tasks be adjusted to allow each character a moment of glory?</p>
<p>Look at the map for locations that might require ability or skill checks.&nbsp; 
Put clues, puzzles, or traps in an unusual places to involve other characters.&nbsp; 
Set DCs by rolling opposed checks in advance. Try and involve every member of 
the party.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a challenge that might require a Balance or Climb check?</li>
  <li>Would a Diplomacy check be needed to get an NPC to reveal a clue?</li>
  <li>Does the character need to speak the right language in order to succeed at 
  a Gather Information check?</li>
  <li>Does a Spot check yield the missing clue to an unsolvable visual puzzle?</li>
  <li>Is a Strength check is needed to move the logs hiding a treasure?</li>
  <li>Is an Intuit Direction check needed to navigate the forest to find the old 
  hermit?</li>
  <li>The floor in the abandoned building is weak 
  or the farmer's field has a sink hole and operates like a pit trap.</li>
  <li>Does an area hedge out characters with the wrong alignment?</li>
  <li>Is a successful Wilderness Lore check needed to impress the local Druid in 
  order to be led to a Centaur's tribe?</li>
  <li>Need a successful Search check needed to find a clue at the scene of a 
  crime?</li>
  <li>Can a desperately needed talisman only be attained at a local skill 
  contest?</li>
  <li>Would a Craft check be needed to build an item as the only method of 
  payment? The smith needs to deliver 20 swords to avoid being evicted but was 
  incapacitated and requires the work  as payment.</li>
