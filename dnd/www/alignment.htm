<h1 align="center">Alignment</h1>
<h4 align="center">by Michael Lambert</h4>
<h4 align="center">Adapted from
<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/diablo/437/thoughts/Alignment.htm">
	Alignment</a> and <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/alex/rec.games.frp.dnd/Alignments">Alignment</a></h4>
<p align="left">Players playing in mixed alignment groups can come into conflict 
as differences in character alignment become evident.&nbsp; For example, 
Rogue-Paladin interaction can often cause a bit of trouble as a character class 
might be restricted to acting within the allowances of a particular alignment.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It can become a concern between 
players during the game and even cause friction.&nbsp; The DM is responsible for tracking and 
adjusting a character's alignment so a DM should communicate in advance how 
some common game scenarios might effect a character's alignment.&nbsp; This way 
players on both sides can think about how a character might react in a scenario and 
anticipate ways to handle it to keep the game balanced. </p>
<p align="left">The guidelines considering lies and concealment 
of the truth do not mean to prevent characters from using disguises or subterfuge  
that might be needed to gain entry into a 
forbidden areas or enemy encampments.&nbsp; A 
Paladin might not be the best choice to drive the wagon that is attempting  to sneak into the enemy fortress but 
surely he could  ride in the back under the hay or wear a disguise. Just be 
aware of the positions they could potentially get into and help avoid 
circumstance that might be too poignant. When you've made your intentions to oppose the villain clear it shouldn't be a 
problem to be smart in how you go about doing it. Use of smart tactics is encouraged. </p>
<p align="left">Also, alignment is not a commodity and attention needs to be 
paid to a character's alignment when collecting loot and how it is collected.&nbsp; 
Contrary to specious arguments the collection of spoils of war, scavenging, or 
looting can affect a character's alignment.&nbsp; The dead do retain ownership 
of their possessions. It would go to those that inherit or be buried with their 
bodies.&nbsp; A landowner retains ownership of all that the land contains even 
for bounty that lies un-recovered in long forgotten dungeons.&nbsp; At the very 
least a tithe would be required for collecting the spoils of war and might be 
above and beyond any tithe requirements imposed by the character's class.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Torment is singled out  from torture and I will try to make the 
distinction clear.&nbsp; It is usually clear and obvious when torture takes 
place but torment can be a more vague form of coercion.&nbsp; In outlining 
torment, the focus as an example might be on a situation where the 
character's purpose is to make an NPC dangle without knowing their fate.&nbsp; 
In this example, a particularly gruesome or 
unpleasant fate might await the NPC unless cooperation with the characters takes 
place. Think of it in relation to the principles of Miranda rights before such a 
distinction were ever made. &nbsp;It 
might be a false intimidation or bluff on the character's part but those actions 
won't sit well with certain alignments.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Don't interpret these guidelines  too rigidly or literally.&nbsp; Those who are truly concerned about this should consider 
purchasing a <i>Phylactery of Faithfulness</i>. Infractions may be hard to 
enforce in a region or a character may experience no immediately observable 
effects in game play but alignment consequences could be accumulating.&nbsp; The 
following is provided so imagine the DM ticking off, considering, or evaluating 
actions related to the following.</p>
